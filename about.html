		<p> Charlotte Jones is a kind and selfless woman who presides in Northwest Indiana. Born and raised in Chicago, Illinois as the only child to a divorced mother, Charlotte grew up to have a family of her own, consisting of 5 children, two of which had been adopted after a good while of being in foster care. Her current hobbies include baking, dancing, good Sci-Fi movies, and most prominent of all of them, Travelling. Her traveling hobby has taken her to a number of places in the world, including across the United States, Paris, Punta Cana, and her favorite destinations so far, London, and Jamaica. Charlotte always had a thing for fairness, which had her set her goal on becoming a lawyer, but that goal shifted to Social Services, as she culminated her education into a bachelor's in behavioral and social sciences to work with those who were homeless and/or mentally ill. Her focus later takes her to foster care, where she works to find caring homes willing to provide for children. Starting at the entry level, she is the regional manager for her workplace. Her aspirations for the future include a number of things, such as starting a Daycare, maybe going back to school for her master’s degree, and creating a hotel/community center for the homeless. 

“Be kind. You’ll never know when you can make someone's day with the simplest kind gesture.” - Charlotte Jones </p>
